# donau-chess
Very easy chess engine, which understands normal moves such as "B7B5" etc. 
Donau chess is just a project to get familiar with JAVA and I wondered if it is possible to build an easy chess game. 
The aim was that I win, in case it really beats me - and it does.
The whole program is held very easy and is not optimized to achieve an extraordinary performance. It just shall work.
So, at least the "Rochade" works, but I have left away the "en passant" beating of the pawn.

Tips to start:
Just play by adding the moves via keyboard. On "D2D4" your Answer will may be "D7D5" Leave away the "x" if you are beating so "D8xD4" will not 
Be understood, "D8D4" will work. You can exit the game by entering "x". 
You can adjust the number of calculation by modifying the variable "Rechentiefe", but be careful ;-) Increasing "Rechentiefe" by 1 will 
Multiply the calculation time by a factor of 10-20 ;-)
The Chess Engine itself is used for an Android app with a real and easy GUI.
